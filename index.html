                  <div class="border-green">Before Epicodus I was working in carpentry as a wooden boat builder on the east coast. The work is great and I really enjoy the industry, but I wanted to make a change. I took an interest in coding because I enjoy problem solving. As coding is always evolving, the opportunities for learning and, thusly problem solving, are never ending. I'm excited to learn more as the curriculum progresses! </div>
